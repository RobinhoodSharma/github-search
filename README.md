## Project Details

To start the project: 

### `npm start`

## Project Architecture

Project is divided into: 

1. Screens: 
All the top level pages are inside screen directory

2. Components: 
All the components are inside component directory

3. Constants: 
Constants like base url are stored in contants directory

## Project Build

To build the project, run `npm run build`. The build code is inside build directory

## Project Deployment

Project is deployed on firebase. Firebase is a google product, specially for apps and web deployment.

To deploy, run firebase deploy.(Note, make sure you setup firebase cli in your local and also create your account in firebase for deployment)

Currently you can access the project on https://github-search-e03b9.firebaseapp.com/

## Thought Process

Before starting any project from scratch, I follow the below steps:

1. Get the requirement and understand it properly
2. Plan the architecture and the approach to be taken for this project.
3. Setup the basic architecture of project(code level).
4. Start building the features step by step.

## Level of complexity

For me, project was not tough as I had already dealt with the github apis in one of my personal project.


Thanks and Cheers,
